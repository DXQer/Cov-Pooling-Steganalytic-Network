# Covariance-Pooling-Steganalytic-Network
A fast and eﬀective global covariance pooling network for image steganalysis in spatial domain.

## About dataset
The training, validation and test set are required to contain two catalogs: cover and stego. What's more, the stego images must have the same name as there corresponding cover images.
